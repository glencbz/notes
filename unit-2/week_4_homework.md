# Week 4 Homework

### Day 5 (Friday)

It's time to use what we learned! Woohoo
* We'll create an Express app! This is **individual work** but feel free to ask for advice/help.
  * Must have a one-to-many relationship between two collections
  * Must have at least 3 RESTful routes:
    * `create`, `findAll`, `findOne/:id`
  * Submit this!
* Exercism! `Pangram` and `Beer Pong`

### Day 4 (Thursday)

* Exercism yet again! Do `Gigasecond`.
* Normalisation Exercise (in Slack)
* Read MongoDB University unit 1 & 2 (log in details in Slack)
  * Focus on Week 2: CRUD

Some tips/reminders if MongoDB doesn't work right: 
* You need to have a `mongod` running, then run `mongo`
* `mongo` shell is not the same as your normal bash shell

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

* [ER Diagrams!](labs/erd-lab.md) Pair up and submit one repo. Commit your diagram to the repo and submit it!
* The next two Exercisms! (for a total of 4). That's `hamming`, `rna`, `bob`, `gigasecond`

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

We're at Express! Hooray. Learn this well, and Express will be your good friend

* Host your game on an Express server! Hint for serving your files: look out for the words "static files" 
  * **Submit this to us as a new GitHub repo!**
  * Turn your HTML page into an EJS template
  * Create at least one route for your game
  * No need for partials!
* [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/javascript/installing) if you're done!

### Day 1 (Monday)

Welcome to the joys of backend programming. We promise it gets better.
* [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode), at least from `HELLO WORLD` to `MAKE IT MODULAR`. Do attempt to read through the rest of the challenges.
