## Day 1 (Monday)

We're going to do Ruby on Rails! Isn't that exciting?. We'll learn about Ruby (the language) before diving too deep into Ruby on Rails (the framework)

- [HackerRank Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ruby/ruby-tutorials/) (introduction of every section)
- [Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) until then end of [Chapter 5, Getting Up and Running](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#getting-up-and-running)
