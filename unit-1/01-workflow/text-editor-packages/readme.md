## Text Editor Packages

Text editor packages help make our lives as developers easier by providing functionalities such as linter error detection, indentation correction, color preview, etc.

#### Useful packages for Atom

Atom comes built in with some packages \(e.g. autocomplete, bracket-matcher, etc\), and you can also install other useful packages. Today, we will install five additional packages which you will find helpful on your journey as a developer.

Note: There are many packages with **very** similar names \(e.g. color-picker vs. colorpicker vs. color picker\). Do look at the name of the package carefully before installing them.
