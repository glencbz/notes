# Week 2 Homework

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

Exercise, exercise, exercise!

* [Stopwatch!](labs/settimeout_and_setinterval.md)
  * Submit this to us as per normal. No jQuery allowed!
* [FCC: All of Object Oriented and Functional Programming!](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/declare-javascript-objects-as-variables)
* [FCC: All of jQuery!](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/learn-how-script-tags-and-document-ready-work)
* [Code School: All of jQuery, again!](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)


### Day 2 (Tuesday)

Today was really conceptual and content-heavy, so don't be discouraged if you didn't catch everything. Some devs work for years without understanding all of it. It will make more sense as you work on more and more problems and do more of your own reading ðŸ™‚. 

* [Functions](labs/functions.md) revisited. This time, we'll replace our `for` loops with iterators. You only need to do the questions that have `for` loops in them 
  * This means, just submit these questions: long 1, short 4, short 7, short 8
  * Submit a **new** GitHub repository for this homework (not the old one)
* [Iterators practice](labs/iterators_practice.md)
* [Callbacks practice](labs/callbacks_practice.md)
* Read up on [jQuery](04-jquery/readme.md), the first library we'll learn in WDI ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. jQuery will be your good friend very soon.

### Day 1 (Monday)

We'll brush up on a lot of fundamentals today. Take this time to really focus on understanding rather than trying to deliver a finished assignment

* [Fellowship of the Ring](labs/fellowship.md) again! Make sure you understand all of the DOM methods. Even if you make it work, ask yourself how it works first
  * You should be able to explain the following:
    * `querySelector` vs `querySelectorAll`
    * `element.querySelector` vs `document.querySelector`
    * `element.innerHTML`
    * `element.removeChild`
* [Learn Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/), 1st section. We would like to see lots and lots of git branches in the future! So do go through these carefully and understand git.
* FreeCodeCamp from [Reverse a string](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/reverse-a-string) to [Largest number in array](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/return-largest-numbers-in-arrays). If you've already done this, feel free to finish the section.
* Read up on [Closures](02-js-jquery/closures.md), [Callbacks](02-js-jquery/js-callbacks-iterators/callbacks.md) and [Iterators](02-js-jquery/js-callbacks-iterators/iterators.md)
  * Pay the most attention to closures! Understanding them is key to debugging a lot of problems with functions
* And of course, think about Project 1 :D
