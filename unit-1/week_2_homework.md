# Week 2 Homework

### Day 1 (Monday)

We'll brush up on a lot of fundamentals today. Take this time to really focus on understanding rather than trying to deliver a finished assignment

* [Fellowship of the Ring](labs/fellowship.md) again! Make sure you understand all of the DOM methods. Even if you make it work, ask yourself how it works first
  * You should be able to explain the following:
    * `querySelector` vs `querySelectorAll`
    * `element.querySelector` vs `document.querySelector`
    * `element.innerHTML`
    * `element.removeChild`
* [Learn Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/), 1st section. We would like to see lots and lots of git branches in the future! So do go through these carefully and understand git.
* FreeCodeCamp from [Reverse a string](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/reverse-a-string) to [Largest number in array](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/return-largest-numbers-in-arrays). If you've already done this, feel free to finish the section.
* Read up on [Closures](02-js-jquery/closures.md), [Callbacks](02-js-jquery/js-callbacks-iterators/callbacks.md) and [Iterators](02-js-jquery/js-callbacks-iterators/iterators.md)
  * Pay the most attention to closures! Understanding them is key to debugging a lot of problems with functions
