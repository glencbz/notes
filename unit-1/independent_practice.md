# Reddit -Independent Practice

Following the directions below to practice using jQuery:

- Go to http://www.reddit.com

- Reddit uses jQuery, so we can use our Chrome developer console to manipulate the site in real time using jQuery.

- To do this, once Reddit.com has loaded, go to your view menu in Chrome. Select View > Developer > JavaScript Console

- Once that's loaded, try entering the following command into the Chrome REPL:

```javascript
$('img').hide()
```

- Hit enter. All the images should have disappeared from the Reddit.com home page. Make sure you understand why before moving on.

- Now try this:
```js
$('img').show()
```

- That should have brought all the images back. Make sense so far?

- Now with the chrome inspector, try to match the title of the first Reddit post and replace the text using `.text()` or `.html()`.

- Try to replace the blue background in the header by another color using the function `.css()`.

- Now try some of the other examples we've gone over in the Chrome REPL and see what happens to the Reddit.com website. Remember, this is your laboratory â€” your chance to experiment and learn. Make use of it.

## Conclusion

- jQuery makes JavaScript super friendly and easy to write. a lot of websites are using jQuery, soon you will too.  Remember that it's always good to know how to use what is called vanilla JavaScript, or JavaScript without a library.

- Please spend some time reviewing [the documentation](https://api.jquery.com/).
