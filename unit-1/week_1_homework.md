# Week 1 Homework

<!---
### Day 4 (Thursday)

There were a lot of new and difficult JavaScript topics introduced today. Don't get discouraged if you didn't internalise them all - it's nearly impossible! Understanding and memory comes with practice, practice and more practice! (so that's what we're going to do)

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

We're going full-on JavaScript today!

* We'll be looking at FreeCodeCamp again, this time from primitives to arrays! [Comment your Javascript code](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) to [Shopping List](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/shopping-list)
* We'll also practice `for` loops: FreeCodeCamp [For Loops](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops) to [Nesting For Loops](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/nesting-for-loops)
* Optional: HackerRank has a cool [30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge. Try it from Day 1 and see how far you can get!
  * It might be a bit confusing because it's meant for all kinds of languages. Just stick with it and Google anything you're not sure of! (remember to change the editor language to Javascript)
  * If you'd like other, cooler exercises, HackerRank has plenty of programming tasks for you to try out.

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

* We're going to recreate a site! Choose either [Airbnb](https://github.com/ga-students/css-airbnb) or [Instagram](https://github.com/ga-students/css-positioning)
  * You'll submit this one too! Same procedure as yesterday's *User Inputs*


* Following up from the HTML CSS challenge (remember HTML User Profile Content?) We'll add onto it using fonts, colors and box model positioning
  * [Fonts and Colors](https://github.com/lewagon/html-css-challenges/tree/master/02-fonts-colors)
  * [Box Model](https://github.com/lewagon/html-css-challenges/tree/master/03-box-model)
  * Remember to make all of the changes in yesterday's repository


* Free Code Camp's Javascript Tutorial, from [Comment your Javascript code](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) to [Word blanks](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/word-blanks)
  * We'll jump deep into Javascript tomorrow, so make sure you familiarise yourself with it now!


* [Code School Dev tools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) (until chapter 4)
  * Do this after the Javascript tutorial so that the later chapters make more sense
### Day 1 (Monday)

* (CodeCademy's Learn the Command Line)[https://codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line]: Do the first part of units 1-3 (don't worry about the pro/paid parts).
* Finish learning [How The Internet Works!](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/code-org/internet-works)
* Solve [Command Line Murder Mystery](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/command-line-murder-mystery)

* [HTML Profile User Content](https://github.com/lewagon/html-css-challenges/tree/master/01-profile-content) 
  * Create a git repository for this homework
  * Add all of the content required (don't worry about CSS just yet)
  * It should contain whatever original stuff you like!

* **[User Inputs!](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/html_user_inputs)**
  * Take note, you'll have to submit this one!
  * Create a GitHub repository
  * Do all of the work required
