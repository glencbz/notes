# Fizz buzz!
Fizz buzz is a game about division. Create a program that will iterate through numbers from 1 to 101 and log each number in the console.

- In the loop every time a number is divisible by **3**, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.
- If the number is divisible by  **5**, the word "buzz" should be logged.
- If the number is divisible by both **3** and  **5**, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.

Hint: Go read about the [Remainder Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators) on MDN and figure out how to use it to simplify this problem.

A typical output in the chrome dev tools would look like this:
